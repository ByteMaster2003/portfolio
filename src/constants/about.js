	"From building high-performance APIs to tinkering with Rust to craft systems that barely flinch under pressure, I'm all about writing code that speaks efficiency and elegance. My toolbox includes Node.js, Express, MongoDB, TypeScript, and lately, a growing obsession with Rust and low-level systems.",
